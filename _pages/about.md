<!-- I am an Associate Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), and a member of the [CIDRE](https://team.inria.fr/cidre/) research team at [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/en)/[Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-rennes-university) in Rennes, France. -->

My research interests span the areas of **hardware security, computer architecture, and reconfigurable computing**. With a background on hardware accelerators and self-adaptive hardware, my latest interests focus on FPGA and embedded systems security, particularly on building hardware and architectural support for security in heterogeneous architectures, hardware accelerators, and emerging computing paradigms.
<!-- I amn currently working on different dimensions of side-channel security of Deep Learning hardware and heterogeneous accelerators, study the interplay between approximate computing and security, and explore remote attacks to FPGAs. Overall, my research work aims at building more efficient, secure and intelligent systems. -->

I obtained my PhD (2015) in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the [Center of Industrial Electronics (CEI)](http://www.cei.upm.es/), [Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)](http://www.upm.es/) working on evolvable hardware in FPGAs, under the supervision of Professors [Eduardo de la Torre](http://www.cei.upm.es/people/faculty/eduardo-de-la-torre/) (CEI, UPM) and [Lukáš Sekanina](https://www.fit.vut.cz/person/sekanina/) ([Brno University of Technology, BUT](https://www.vutbr.cz/en/?aid_redir=1)).

Previously, I was Assistant Professor (2017--2019) and Teaching Assistant (2012--2017) at the [School of Telecommunications Systems and Engineering](https://www.etsist.upm.es/), UPM, and Research Assistant (2006--2011) at [CEI, UPM](http://www.cei.upm.es/) and (2005--2006) at the Intelligent Vehicle Systems division at [INSIA](https://insia-upm.es/en/), UPM.

<!-- In 2017 I was a visiting research professor for 5 months at IETR-[INSA Rennes](https://www.insa-rennes.fr/), in Rennes, France; and in 2009 a visiting research student for 4 months at the [Evolvable Hardware Research group](https://www.fit.vut.cz/research/group/ehw/), [Faculty of Information Technology](https://www.fit.vut.cz/), BUT, in Brno, Czech Republic. -->
