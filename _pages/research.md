My research interests span the areas of **hardware security, computer architecture, and reconfigurable computing**. With a background on hardware accelerators and self-adaptive hardware, my latest interests focus on **FPGA and embedded systems security**, particularly on building **hardware and architectural support for security in heterogeneous architectures, hardware accelerators, and emerging computing paradigms**.

My approach is based on a cross-layer, design-for-security methodology to mitigate hardware and software-induced attacks, including: (1) vulnerability discovery in existing micro/architectures of hardware accelerators, (2) Design Space Exploration for secure micro/architectures, and (3) design of countermeasures based on adaptive micro/architectures, software codes and runtime managers.

I am currently working on different dimensions of side-channel security of Deep Learning hardware and heterogeneous accelerators, studying the interplay between approximate computing and security, and exploring remote attacks to FPGAs. <!--  Overall, my research work aims at building more efficient, secure and intelligent systems.-->
