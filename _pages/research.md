My research interests lie at the intersection of **hardware security, computer architecture, and self-adaptive systems**, with a particular interest in **heterogeneous architectures, reconfigurable accelerators, and emerging computing paradigms**.
I build on a hardware background and experience in reconfigurable and heterogeneous computing, to focus on **hardware and architectural support for secure and flexible computing systems**, from embedded systems at the edge to remote cloud computing infrastructures.

My approach is based on a cross-layer, design-for-security methodology to mitigate hardware and software-induced attacks, including: (1) vulnerability discovery in existing micro/architectures of hardware accelerators, (2) Design Space Exploration for secure micro/architectures, and (3) design of countermeasures based on adaptive micro/architectures, software codes and runtime managers.
